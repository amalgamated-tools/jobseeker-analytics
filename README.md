## **About Just A Job App (JAJA)**

In 2024, I was laid off by an email.

I started applying and despite tailoring my resume for 100 roles, received nothing but automated rejections. The lack of feedback was frustrating.

Existing job search tools operate on a broken, transactional model: a user pays for a resume rewrite or an ATS scan, but there is no feedback loop to validate if these actions lead to more interviews.

JAJA closes that feedback loop with our email integration - we can tell if you're actually landing interviews after that resume rewrite.

It's important to me that this project remains independent and open-source, with jobseekers and not shareholders top of mind.

### Immediate Priorities
1. October 2025: Complete and pass Google's OAuth Application Security Audit.
2. November 2025: Launch JAJA(Pro), a paid cloud-hosted version for users who require access without local installation.
3. December 2025: With initial revenue from JAJA(Pro), we'll begin development of the Story Engine feature.
