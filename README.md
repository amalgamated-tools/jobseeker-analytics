## **About Just A Job App (JAJA)**

In 2024, I was laid off by an email. Existing job search tools are just as broken and transactional. A user pays for a resume rewrite, but there‚Äôs no feedback loop to see if it works.

Today, JAJA closes that loop. It syncs with a user‚Äôs email to surface interview invitations, highlighting which application strategies are successful.

### Current State of the Job Search

It's not a numbers game anymore. There are 25% more job applications per posting since the pandemic. Recruiters are scrambling to find qualified applicants in a pile of generic, often irrelevant, resumes. Hiring managers are afraid of getting scammed by international espionage. Authentic, human signal is more important than ever.

### What's next for JAJA?

We need to shift the focus from manufacturing generic resumes to marketing **undeniably human** achievements that leave hiring managers wanting to interview you.

Cue, the "Accomplishment Vault": A tool to help you quantify your accomplishments and craft specific stories that resonate with hiring managers.

### What's next for JAJA?
1. Pass Google's required security audit.
2. Launch JAJA(Pro), the paid cloud version for users who are strapped for time or don't want to install anything.
3. Develop the Accomplishment Vault.
