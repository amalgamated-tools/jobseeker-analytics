The job search is officially broken, and it's not just you. Applications per hire have tripled since early 2021, leaving even qualified candidates stuck in an endless cycle of submitting resumes into the void.

## Problem: The Job Search is Officially Broken

Does this sound familiar? You spend hours tailoring your resume and writing the perfect cover letter, only to send it into a black hole. Days turn into weeks. The only reply is a generic rejection email, or worse, complete silence.

You're not imagining it. The game has changed:
- **It's 3x more competitive:** The number of applications per hire has tripled since early 2021.
- **It's overwhelming:** Our research shows 77% of job seekers use over three different tools to manage a process 64% already find frustrating.
- **It's leading to burnout:** 64% of applicants report feeling exhausted and stuck.
